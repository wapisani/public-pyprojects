# Minesweeper

This is a text-based game of minesweeper I wrote to practice my Python skills. It has been generalized to work for any size grid, but it works best at 26x26 or less.

It has been tested to run in the Spyder IDE as well as in a native Linux environment and Bash on Ubuntu on Windows 10. It produces strange output on Windows 10 using the command prompt. That is due to Windows charset default not being compatible with unicode. You can get around this by typing "chcp 65001" prior to typing "python minesweeper.py". This may not the best solution, though.

If you do not already have Python 3.7+ on your system, I recommend downloading the latest version of Anaconda Python 3 for running minesweeper.py.
