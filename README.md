# Will Pisani's Public Python Projects

Hi! Welcome to my public Python projects! I hope you find them interesting and/or useful.

## [Soundrop Royalty Report Generator](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Soundrop)
I make video game music covers in some of my free time and I license them via a company called [Soundrop](https://soundrop.com/). Soundrop handles all of the licensing for me and distributes my covers to the major storefronts. Each month, Soundrop sends me a CSV with a list of streams and purchases broken down by country, service, track, etc. I wrote a couple Python scripts to parse the CSVs, plot various metrics, and create HTML reports. This allows me to gain insight into listener trends and helps me decide which songs to cover next. I used pandas and matplotlib, as well as the [W3.CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) for styling.
