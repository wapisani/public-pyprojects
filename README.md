# Will Pisani's Public Python Projects

Hi! Welcome to my public Python projects! I hope you find them interesting and/or useful.

## [Soundrop Royalty Report Generator](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Soundrop)
I make [video game music covers](https://music.pisani.me/) in some of my free time and I license them via a company called [Soundrop](https://soundrop.com/). Soundrop handles all of the licensing for me and distributes my covers to the major storefronts. Each month, Soundrop sends me a CSV with a list of streams and purchases broken down by country, service, track, etc. I wrote a couple Python scripts to parse the CSVs, plot various metrics, and create HTML reports. This allows me to gain insight into listener trends and helps me decide which songs to cover next. I used pandas and matplotlib, as well as the [W3.CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) for styling. 

## [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/APoD_Scraper) Bulk Image Downloader
The images that [APoD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) features are often gorgeously wallpaper-worthy and there is no way to bulk download the images easily. So I wrote a Python script which allows you to download the entire archive or the current picture of the day. Uses requests and bs4 for scraping.

## [Wordle GUI Assistant](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Wordle_Solver)
A simple GUI to help the user solve Wordle. Uses PySimpleGUI.

## [Minesweeper](https://github.com/wapisani/public-pyprojects/tree/main/Minesweeper)
This is a text-based game of minesweeper I wrote to practice my Python skills. It has been generalized to work for any size grid, but it works best at 26x26 or less.
