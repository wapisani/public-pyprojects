# Litsy Scarathlon Game: Week 1
"Name as many books as possible that have something in common with either of your team's buddy reads. This can be anything other than the genre. 10 points per answer. Unlimited points available"

On team Bat Brigade our buddy reads were "Pumpkinheads" by Rainbow Rowell and Faith Erin Hicks and "A Dowry of Blood" by S.T. Gibson.

## The Approach
I love programming and my go-to language is Python. When I saw this game, I thought "Oooh, I bet I could query an internet book database for keywords related to each book and get tons of results back (points are unlimited after all)". After confirming with my wife, @catsandbooks, that this approach is "legal" re: the Scarathlon rules, I set about finding a database I could query for free easily. I found the [Open Library Search API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) to be very easy to use with just a web browser.
