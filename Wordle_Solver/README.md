My wife introduced me to Wordle a few days ago. Immediately I thought that coding up a Wordle solver/assistant would be a fun project and fairly simple to code. My initial Wordle assistant was clunky and needed to be edited after each guess. I used the PySimpleGUI library to make a simple GUI that works fairly well. 


## How do I use it?
You will need a Python 3.8+ installation with the PySimpleGUI library. Once PySimpleGUI is installed, unzip this directory to the location of your choosing, then run the GUI script with the command ```python Wordle_Solver_GUI.py```. If using the command prompt or terminal, you will first need to navigate to that directory using ```cd```. You can also use an IDE like Spyder to run it.

## Future Improvements
Spruce up the GUI.
